# Command Line

GUI - Graphical User Interface

## Using the Linux Command Line
- keyboard based commands for working within IDE or any UNIX-based system.

- ls
	- list
- cd 
	- change directory
	- The shorthand name for the current dir is .
	- The shorthand name for the parent dir is ..
- pwd
	- present working directory
	- shows the current dir.
- mkdir <directory>
	- create a new dir.
- cp <source> <destination>
	- copy, creates a duplicate
	- if oyu wish to copy entire dir:
	cp -r <source directory> <destination directory>
	- -r stands for recursive
- rm <file>
	- remove, will delete <file>
	- rm -r to remove a dir, r again for recursive
- mv  <source> <destination>
	- move, will effectively rename a file, moving it from <source> to <destination> 

Skipped through this mostly since I am already familiar with command line interaction -> see tutorials.
